      Notification
    If a City inspector determines that the property they are inspecting violates any of the City’s housing standards, (link to http://www.nola.gov/RESIDENTS/Code-Enforcement/City-of-New-Orleans-Housing-Standards/) the owner receives a Notice of Violation, which lists the specific violations observed, and gives a hearing date. The notice is posted on the property and is mailed to the owner as part of a Notice of Violation packet.

      Hearing
    If a property owner does not correct the violations observed by City inspectors, an administrative hearing is conducted by an impartial judge. The judge determines whether the property is in compliance, or guillty of public nuisance or blight.

    At the hearing, both the City and the property owner testify under oath. The City presents the evidence against the owner and neighbors are allowed to offer testimony. The property owner has the right to be represented by an attorney, present evidence, introduce witnesses, and question city inspectors under oath.

    If a property owner has made repairs, they should bring photographs and copies of contracts to the hearing. If they cannot attend the hearing, a representative that has been given power of attorney can attend in their place.

      Reset
    During a hearing, an owner has the opportunity to enter into an agreement to make the necessary repairs to their properties. If they do this, the Code Enforcement Department gives them a “reset” hearing date. During a reset hearing, the owner must show that they have completed the work outlined in the agreement. If they have not, daily fines can begin.
